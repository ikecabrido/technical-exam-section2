        <p>
          I walked through the door with you <br />
          The air was cold <br />
          But something about it felt like home somehow <br />
          And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house <br />
          And you've still got it in your drawer even now
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, your sweet disposition <br />
          And my wide-eyed gaze <br />
          We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate <br />
          Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place <br />
          And I can picture it after all these days
        </p>
        <p>
          And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more <br />
          And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
        </p>
        <p>
          'Cause there we are again on that little town street <br />
          You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me <br />
          Wind in my hair, I was there I remember it all too well
        </p>
        <p>
          Photo album on the counter <br />Your cheeks were turning red
          <br />You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
          <br />
          And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
          <br />
          You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
        </p>
